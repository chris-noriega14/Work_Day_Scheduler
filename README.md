Application Description: 

  This application has a header at the top of the webpage with the title of Work Day Scheduler, a brief description of the app, and today's date.

  The body of the application is broken down by times of the day, with the earliest time at the top. Looking at one time slot, the time is displayed on the left hand side of the screen, followed by a space for the user to add upcoming events and notes, then finally a Save button in order to Save the information in local storage. 
  
  Once a time slot has been passed today, the space for the event input is grayed out and the user can no longer add anything to that space. The current time slot according to the day will have a red background and future time slots will have a green background. The times on the left hand side have been initially set up as military time, then converted to standard time.
